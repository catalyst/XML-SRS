Description: PRANG implementation of the XML SRS protocol
 This module is an implementation of the XML protocol used by the .nz
 registry.  This protocol was developed in 2002, using what were
 considered stable XML standard methods at the time, such as SGML DTD.
 This compares to the now de-facto standard, EPP (RFC3730, friends and
 updates), which was developed using XML Schema and XML Namespaces.  As
 such, the SRS protocol as a stable standard far pre-dates EPP, which
 took a further 2 years to reach 1.0 status.
 .
 This module currently implements the XML part of the protocol only;
 converting this into the HTTPS POST, with PGP signature, is still
 TO-DO.
