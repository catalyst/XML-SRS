=over

=item *

Use the existing convenience coercion rules for L<XML::SRS::Contact>
fields on L<XML::SRS::Registrar> contact fields.

=item *

Support setting all the date/time XML fields with one Moose attribute,
and coerce TimeStamp values from L<MooseX::TimestampTZ> types
(hopefully this will cascade to allow any ISO-8601 form supported by
that module)

=item *

The C<epp_auth> property of L<XML::SRS::Registrar> can be set to the
unencrypted or a pre-encrypted string, and it will automatically get
turned into an encrypted, salted string if required, thanks to the
magical awesomeness of L<Crypt::Password>.

=back

=item *

A couple of attribute renames; like L<XML::EPP>, any non-perlish
attribute name is subject to being renamed to be perlish :-)

Added a note to the main L<XML::SRS> man page to make it clear that
this might happen.

=item *

Add global L<$XML::SRS::PROTOCOL_VERSION>
